# U_TypeScript_TodoList

First small project using TypeScript 

Created a ToDo list using TypeScript working with the DOM, 
the Lib Compiler, aknowleging Non-Null Assertion Operator 
and Type Assertions, using Interface for the Todo and the 
LocalStorage to keep the input data updated for the user.

Small styiling applied with Mobile-First approach.
